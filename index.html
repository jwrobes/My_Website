				<h2>History of Van Gogh</h2>
				<P>Van Gogh was found by Jonathan Wrobel 17 years ago on a road trip from California to Providence, RI.  With time to kill at the underground mall in Atlanta, Georgia, Jonathan and his road trip partner Gonosuke Fujisaki competed to see who could buy something better at the Dollar Store.  No one remembers what Go purchased, but Jonathan's red pig is now an international sensation.  He began his adventures by being kicked around the mall like a soccer ball, immediately lost an ear, and earning his name.  Van Gogh has been to 45 out of the 50 states, four different continents, and he has only just begun! </P>
